Validations -- adds checks we don't want to do manually. E.g.:

    class Patient
        validates :username, presence: true 
    function ^     ^ attribute   ^ type of validation 

other validation types: length, 
                            ^ e.g.: length: {miniumum: 4}

can use conditionals with if: -> [anonymous function]
*procs/lambdas

rails console command: patient.valid? -- returns true/false. checks locally; doesn't interact w/ db



In ruby, object (array where all keys have values)

models are classes; these are the type that can have Validations


Callbacks

before_save :announce_save
^ keyword     ^method to execute

instead of calling method, can call block

see rails guides for order in which they execute

**don't overuse them
