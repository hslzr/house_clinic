Validate for:

1. Patient model
    - age is positive
    - patients are older than 21, else they have a parent (parent_id can be column in patient table)

2. Consultation model
    - start_time is before end_time
    - start_time is after the current time right now
    - both start_time and end_time are present

3. Doctor model
    - whichever validations would make sense per business logic
